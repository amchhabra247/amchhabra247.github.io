			Butter Chicken
		</h2>
		<p>
			Butter Chicken is a dish that is made in the North of India. 
			Pieces of juicy, succulent chicken are cooked in a thick spiced tomato, butter and
			creamy sauce.
		</p> 
		<h3>
			The reciepe to make Butter Chicken is as follows:
		</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Sauté onions, garlic and ginger for a few minutes.</li>
			<li>Stir in butter, stock, tomato paste, all of the spices—the flavorful base of 
			    the butter chicken sauce!—followed by all of the chicken pieces.</li>
			<li>Pop a lid on the pan and simmer until the chicken is done.</li>
			<li>Stir in lemon juice and heavy cream, and simmer on low for just a few minutes 
			    to let everything cohere.</li>
			<li>You’re done! We love this with plain, steamed basmati rice, and serve some 
			    warm naan on the side if you’ve got it!.</li>
