			I love watching Movies!!!
		</h2>
		<p>
			Watching Movies is my favourite past time. Movies depict stories in very artistic and creative ways. 
			I like to empathize with the characters and feel the emotions that they are feeling during the entire 
			movie. My favourite genre of movies is Comedy and Thriller. Below, I would be talking about my three 
			favourite movies and a description about the movie. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>    My three favourite movies are:
